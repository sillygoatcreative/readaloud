<p><b>Anna, a nine-year-old girl thinks one must have a difficult childhood in order to
become famous. She is about to qualify for greatness if that is the test, because her
family becomes refugees, fleeing from Hitler. They are Jewish, although not religious, and
her father is a writer who speaks out against the regime. <u>When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit</u>
is a diary of the family's travels to Switzerland, France, and finally England. It is a
gentle story of this difficult time, and details the struggles of leaving behind all
material goods, adapting to different cultures, and learning French.</b></p>

<p><b>I found this recommendation on the Internet; author John Updike said it was a book
he loved as a teenager. It was &#133; not what I expected, but we had fun reading it
aloud. It was chock full of alliteration, musical language, and some of the humor reminded
me of the Marx Brothers. It is a silly summer story you will enjoy, about a king, an
amnesiac princess, a dwarf and three princes.</b></p>

<p><b>This is a great book to read if your children enjoy dressing up in army fatigues and
exploring nature, but may not have much opportunity to do so. It is the story of a
thirteen-year-old &quot;nature boy&quot; who spends a year living in a burned out tree. I
read this book when I was a teen, and although I don't agree with the premise of his
&quot;running away&quot; now that I'm a parent, I still think it is a wonderful book. It
is especially good for reluctant readers around eleven years of age, or children who
complain of being bored.</b><img
