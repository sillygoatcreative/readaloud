<h1><u>The Abracadabra Kid -- A Writer's Life</u> </h1>

<h3><font SIZE="+2">by Sid Fleischman</font> </h3>

<h4>Sid Fleischman's autobiography worked magic for us! From his childhood fascination
with legerdemain, his association with magic clubs and vaudeville shows, to taking his own
act on the road (at 16), comes forth&nbsp;an&nbsp;enchanting story . &nbsp;It inspires
future writers (I gave it to my daughter) and is filled with hints to develop story
writing. Sorry, the secrets for the magic tricks were not disclosed. </h4>

<h4>After reading <u>The Abracadabra Kid</u>, we were compelled to check out Sid
Fleischman's books for children. &nbsp;I presented <u>Humbug Mountain</u> (riding
riverboats in the old west) and <u>The Ghost in the Noonday Sun </u>&nbsp;(with ghosts,
pirates and treasure) to Robert, my 10 -year- old son who &quot;hated to read&quot;.
&nbsp;Sid Fleischman is now Robert's favorite author. We are scouring stores for a shiner
so he can cheat at cards (smile)! We've read aloud <u>Mr. Mysterious and Company</u> , <u>The
Whipping Boy </u>(Newbery medal winner) and <u>Jim Ugly</u>. You can't go wrong with these
books; they are hilarious, light-hearted, and ironic. &nbsp;Sid Fleischman is a master
of&nbsp;similes and metaphors. Enjoy comedy tonight!</h4>

  <h4>This was Sid Fleischman's first children's book! Sid Fleischman modeled the characters
  after his children and used their ideas in writing this book. It is a wonderful story
  about a magician and his family in the old west, travelling to California to settle down.
  Find out about a new holiday your family may celebrate: <b>Abracadabra Day! </b>I read
  this book to four homeschoolers, ages 7-13 and it brightened their days.</h4>

  <h4>An interesting story, for which Sid Fleischman won the Newbery Award, however, it was
  rather simplistic and we enjoyed his other books more.<img
