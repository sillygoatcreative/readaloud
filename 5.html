<p align="left">Fill in the info and click the auction you want.&nbsp; If you are
submitting to ebay its a good idea to select the category first.&nbsp; This will cause the
web page to load much faster.&nbsp; If you select eBay or amazon the starting bid and
location will be filled in for you when the browser opens.</p>

<p align="left">If you are submitting your listing to Yahoo or Boxlot or any other auction
other then eBay or Amazon then you will have to do one more step in order to submit your
listing.</p>

<p align="left">Lets say you want to submit a listing to Yahoo.&nbsp; You would click the
Yahoo button.&nbsp; Your browser will load and you will be instructed to select a category.
&nbsp; After this is done your browser will load the page that you use to input all the
auction information.&nbsp; For Yahoo it looks like what you see below.&nbsp; Place your
mouse cursor into the text box that is entitled Description.&nbsp; Right-Click your mouse
button.&nbsp; This will bring up a menu like the one shown below.&nbsp; Select Paste.
&nbsp; This will insert your entire listing into the description window.&nbsp; It's easy
and it works very well.</p>
