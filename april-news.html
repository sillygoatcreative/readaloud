He introduced the immigrant family to great literature by reading aloud each evening, and gave them his books when he left. Mama realized his gift was greater than the rent he owed. I looked up the book, <U>Mama's Bank Account</U>, and have quoted a passage here:</B></P>  <UL> <H4><FONT COLOR="#000080">One night he (Mr. Hyde) began to read Dickens to us. Soon it became an accepted fact that after our homework was done, Mr. Hyde would bring down one of his books and read aloud. And strange new worlds were opened to us.</FONT></H4>  <H4><FONT COLOR="#000080">&quot;They are like sagas,&quot; Mama said. &quot;Wonderful.&quot;</FONT></H4>  <H4><FONT COLOR="#000080">After <U>David Copperfield</U> and <U>The Old Curiosity Shop</U>, Mr. Hyde gave us Shakespeare. He had a fine deep voice and sounded as we imagined a great actor would sound.</FONT></H4>  <H4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Even when the warm weather came we children didn't beg to go out in the evenings to play one-foot-off-the-gutter. I think Mama was glad; she never liked us running the streets.</FONT></H4>  <H4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Best of all, Nels went less and less to the street corner to hang around with the neighborhood boys. The night they got into trouble for breaking into Mr. Dillon's store Nels was home with us. He'd wanted to hear the last chapter of <U>Dombey and Son</U>.</FONT></H4> </UL>  <H4 ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#000080">...from <U>Mama's Bank Account</U>, by Kathryn Forbes</FONT></H4></DIV> <FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT> <P>&nbsp</P><P>&nbsp</P><P></P> <H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">A WORD FROM GROUCHO</FONT></H3>  <H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">And for those of you who doubt the value of watching TV, I will let Groucho answer:</FONT></H4>  <UL> <H4><FONT COLOR="#000080"
