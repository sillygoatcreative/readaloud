<p>The Moody family's story begins with the book <u>Little Britches</u>, right after they
move to Colorado to try their hand at ranching. One quickly becomes endeared to Ralph's
father, Charles.&nbsp; In this book Ralph gets his nickname of &quot;Little
Britches&quot;.&nbsp; As the series continues, you become acquainted with all of Ralph's
family, and they are some of the best friends that you never met!</p>

<p>In <u>Man of the Family</u> and <u>Mary Emma &amp; Company</u>, you respect the
strength of Ralph's mother, Mary Emma.&nbsp; In <u>The Fields of Home</u> you meet Ralph's
grandfather, Thomas J. Gould, and Ralph's great-uncle, Levi Gould.</p>

<p>The <u>Dry Divide</u> takes place in Kansas and Nebraska, where you learn about
harvesting and threshing wheat, and also about a unique harvesting crew. You cannot start
the series without finishing it, and you might even catch yourself saying &quot;By fire,
we;ll show them what kind of logs makes wide shingles&quot; or &quot;Tarnal fool yella
colt,&quot; but if you talk too much like that people will get to thinking you are a
&quot;horse of a different color!&quot;&nbsp; Would you like to know more about Ralph and
his brothers and sisters? The <u>Little Britches</u> series is now in print again, so you
may have these wonderful books in your personal library.</p>
