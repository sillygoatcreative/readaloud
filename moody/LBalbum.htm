<p>The <u>Dry Divide</u> takes place in Kansas and Nebraska, where you learn about
harvesting and threshing wheat, and also about a unique harvesting crew. You cannot start
the series without finishing it, and you might even catch yourself saying &quot;By fire,
we'll show them what kind of logs makes wide shingles&quot; or &quot;Tarnal fool yella
colt,&quot; but if you talk too much like that, people will get to thinking you are a
&quot;horse of a different color!&quot;&nbsp; Would you like to know more about Ralph and
his brothers and sisters? The <u>Little Britches</u> series is now in print again, so you
may have these wonderful books in your personal library.</p>
