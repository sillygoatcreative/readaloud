<p><strong>The above picture was taken in Littleton, Colorado, in front of one of the
houses the family lived in.&nbsp; The people are: (back) Charles Moody, or father;
(middle) Muriel, Grace, Mary Emma (mother), and Charles Moody's cousin's wife; (front)
Philip, Hal, and Ralph.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Notice the three boys are looking down. A few weeks before, a little black dog
that they were all very fond of disappeared. Right at the time of this picture, however,
the little black dog came around the corner of the house and the boys were all looking at
him. Unfortunately, the dog disappeared again; possibly due to a neighbor who didn't like
him tromping through his/her garden.&nbsp; This picture was taken six months before
Ralph's father died.</strong></p>
