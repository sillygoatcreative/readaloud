<p>When you place images in your ebay auctions they actually reside on your personal web
page directory. This electronic piece of real estate is located on your WEB providers
computer. If you go over your allotted amount of space you will be charged extra.</p>

<p>The way to avoid this is to periodically delete the images you are no longer using.
When you click 'View Files' it will show you the root directory of your home page. This is
not on your local hard drive. this is on the Internet.</p>

<p>Carefully go through the list of images and select with your mouse a file you are no
longer using. After the file name is highlighted just click 'Delete File'. The file will
be removed from your web space. </p>

<p>If you save your descriptions you can reload them to refresh your memory as to the file
names of your images. If you have your own web page be careful not to delete any images
that are connected with it.</p>
