<H4><FONT COLOR="#800080"><FONT SIZE=+2>Bienvenue to the Robinson Reading

Room and Bookstore</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">, &nbsp;<FONT SIZE=+1>where

we expound upon the joys of families, frie</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>nds,

and teachers reading aloud. Explore the picture to find reviews of our

favorite books and authors. They will enrich your family greatly. </FONT></H4>



<H4><FONT SIZE=+1>Some of these books may be hard to find; they were published

generations ago, and are just now being reprinted! Through our association

with Amazon.com Books, you may order them right from our page. &nbsp;Just

be sure to come back to order the sequels; we know you will, since reading

aloud tends to be habit-forming!&nbsp;</FONT> </H4>



<H4><FONT SIZE=+1>Here are some benefits we've experienced from reading

aloud:</FONT> </H4>



<H4><B>Reading aloud ...</B> </H4>



<UL>

<H4><B>FOSTERS OUR LOVE OF LITERATURE. Once we start a great book, we can

hardly close it after a chapter or two. &nbsp;&quot;Don't stop reading,

don't put the book away,&quot; our children protest.</B> </H4>



<H4><B>PROVIDES ENGLISH ENRICHMENT. We read books that are above our children's

reading abilities, and introduce them to literature, vocabulary words,

and sophisticated language structure.</B> </H4>



<H4><B>SOLVES READING PROBLEMS. Reading aloud motivates and encourages

reluctant readers (this may include your spouse!) and those with reading

disabilities.</B> </H4>



<H4><B>&nbsp;BUILDS CLOSER FAMILY &nbsp;TIES. We bond and grow up with

characters in stories, they become our friends, and we hate to see &quot;The

End&quot;. For this reason we recommend series books or several books by

an author we enjoy.</B> </H4>

</UL>



<H1><FONT SIZE=+2>Chapter 1: How We Became a Read Aloud Family</FONT> </H1>



<P><I><FONT COLOR="#800080"><FONT SIZE=+2>Make thy friends books, and thy

books friends. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...Ben Jonson</FONT></FONT></I>

</P>



<H4>How did we discover that reading books together would provide such

pleasure and be a springboard for real-life adventures and vacations? By

accident, of course. </H4>



<H4>We've been <I>nouveau pauvre </I>ever since we married, had children,

and tried living on one income. The public library became our favorite

haunt. My husband, Rick, and I re-discovered children's books; we took

delight in old friends (Curious George, Dr. Seuss) while encountering new

authors (Chris Van Allsburg, David Macaulay). Almost ten years later, we've

moved on to books which gratify adults and children, yet we still find

gems in the children's section. </H4>



<H4>Our daughter Rachel's first grade teacher made the recommendation:

&quot;NEVER STOP READING ALOUD TO YOUR CHILDREN, EVEN AFTER THEY ARE INDEPENDENT

READERS&quot;. &nbsp;So we instituted a family reading time, the hour after

dinner. &nbsp;When we moved to upstate N.Y. and were without TV reception

for six months, the reading habit was pretty easy to adhere to, although

it still required discipline. The challenge was to get all family members

sitting together while I opened a book! </H4>



<H4><U>The Little House on the Prairie</U>&nbsp;series (not the Hollywood

version, but the Laura Ingalls Wilder books) sustained us that winter.

We finished all nine Little House books; it took about a year since our

children were under 8 years old. &nbsp;Then depression set in. We felt

we had lost our best friends: Pa, Ma, Laura, Mary, and Almanzo among others.

Would we ever find a series we loved as much? </H4>



<H4>Fortunately, Rachel and I stumbled across the <U>Betsy-Tacy </U>series,

set in Minnesota in the early 1900's. Then a high school English teacher

recommended <U>Swallows and Amazons</U>, by Arthur Ransome. She had just

returned from a trip to England and the Lake District which inspired Arthur

Ransome to write&nbsp;<U>Swallows and Amazons.</U>&nbsp; I met another

read-aloud family; they gave me a &quot;five star recommendation&quot;:

the <U>Little Britches</U> series by Ralph Moody. It has been over five

years and we're still reading books aloud, even though our children are

teenagers (or rapidly approaching teens) and we now have satellite TV!

&nbsp;We 've created our web-site bookstore to recommend our favorite authors

and books, and to encourage you to try reading aloud!</H4>



<P><B>We are also committed to being a read-aloud support page, and will

post quotes and comments from books and movies which emphasize read-aloud

families. Feel free to E-mail &nbsp;<I><A HREF="mailto:mary@readaloud.com">The

Swift Family Robinson</A></I> with any comments, suggestions or book recommendations!
