<h1>The Betsy-Tacy Books&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font SIZE="+2">by Maud Hart
Lovelace</font></h1>

<h3><ING SRC="bets.gif"><i>Related Topics: Writer, Family life in the early 1900's, Boyfriends, Opera,
Theatre, Vaudeville, Imagination</i></h3>

<h4>Travel to Mankato, Minnesota and grow up with Betsy Ray, from meeting best friend,
Tacy, at age five, through her marriage to high school sweetheart and writer, Joe.&nbsp;
You will fall in love with Betsy, her friends, and her ever -present imagination.</h4>

<h4>The <u>Betsy-Tacy</u> books are great for nostalgia buffs. First published in 1940,
they made our family yearn for years past, when children were imaginative in play,
vaudeville was going strong, the auto was first appearing, and teenagers, well, they
gathered in gangs to sing together!</h4>

<h4>&nbsp;Sunday nights were hopping at the Ray house, with the gang singing 'round the
piano and Betsy's dad frying onion sandwiches. Life was filled with music; dance cards
were filled with schottisches, two-steps and waltzes. Some things don't seem dated, such
as the school escapades where few actually read the assigned <u>Ivanhoe</u> or when
Betsy's science project of dried leaves is accomplished the night before it is due. But
how about this? Betsy's father owned a shoe store in town. The Ray family employed a
live-in cook and housekeeper even though Mrs. Ray <i>did not work outside the home</i>.
Those were the days, my friend.</h4>
