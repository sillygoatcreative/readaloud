<h2>by Ralph Moody </h2>
<h4><b>Ralph Moody was eight years old in 1906, when his family moved to Colorado. 
  &nbsp;When he was twenty-one, he wrote in a diary that he would work as hard 
  as he could to save $50,000 by the time he was fifty, and then write a book. 
  He began <u>Little Britches</u> on his 50th birthday! After reading of the character 
  -building hardships his family faced in settling in Colorado, it didn't surprise 
  me that he kept his word. He has an incredible life story; it will touch your 
  heart as you read it. Ralph Moody's books are excellent material for U.S. history 
  / literature classes (teachers, take note!)</b><font
COLOR="#000080"> </font></h4>
<p><b>On the cover of <u>Little Britches</u> is the recommendation that Ralph 
  Moody's books &quot;should be read aloud in every family circle in America.&quot; 
  (---Sterling North)</b> </p>

  <h5><font SIZE="+0">No review can do this book justice. It's a gripping family 
    story from beginning to end, and the first of the series, so you must start 
    here.</font></h5>

  <h4>At 11 years old, Ralph becomes man of the family and an entrepreneur. He 
    continues his horse riding, cattle driving, and the Moodys start a cooking 
    business. The struggles of a family who refuses to rely on charity are enormous. 
    Then Mom gets a revelation about washing and stretching lace curtains...</h4>

  <h4>This book repeats some experiences and adds new ones to the time period 
    of <u>Man of the Family</u>. We tried reading it after <u>The Fields of Home</u>, 
    but wanted to go forward, not back in time. We'll probably return when we've 
    finished the series and are crying for more.</h4>

  <h4>In January, 1913, the Moodys must relocate, and go east to Medford, Massachusetts. 
    Mrs. Moody, a widow with six children, struggles to find a job and establish 
    their home. Ralph, at thirteen, is still a resourceful entrepreneur, but Mom 
    and Grace figure prominantly in this book. With much faith, perseverance, 
    and God's blessings, Mom (Mary Emma), Grace, and Ralph are living in a beautiful 
    home and running their own business by May of the same year.</h4>

  <h4>Probably the most frustrating book of the series, about when Ralph moves 
    to Maine to work his grandfather's farm. Grandfather is not a very reasonable 
    man, to put it nicely. Hang in there readers, and the ending will be your 
    reward.</h4>

  <h4><b>Ralph moves back west because of health reasons and becomes a movie stunt 
    &quot;fall rider&quot; and then an itinerant artist. He meets a friend, Lonnie, 
    who convinces him to buy his first car. The book has a surprise ending and 
    life lesson: don't keep your life savings in the cuff of your pants!</b></h4>

  <h4>Ralph is thrown off a train in McCook, Nebraska, with only a dime in his 
    pocket, and is hired as a wheat pitcher. He discovers why his hateful share-cropper 
    employer travels to distant towns to find a crew. Fate intervenes, however, 
    and Ralph becomes the boss and leads his motley crew to succeed in more than 
    one business venture. As always, Ralph inspires loyalty and friendship in 
    the hired hands: Doc, a &quot;medicine man&quot; when he gets into the tanglefoot, 
    Gus and Lars, the Swedish workers with a hidden talent (&quot;Yiminy, Dat 
    is Fun!&quot;), and Paco, a young Mexican with the gift of understanding horses.</h4>

  <h4>This last book is as good as the first of the Little Britches series. We 
    stood in awe of Ralph Moody's talents as an entrepreneur, his work ethic, 
    and his maturity in his early 20's. We also loved the characters in Beaver 
    Valley (which Ralph called the friendliest place on earth): Effie, the switchboard 
    operator who helps Ralph succeed in business by providing the farm wives' 
    point of view, and George Miner, a wise and respected farmer who becomes a 
    second father to Ralph. This book is an excellent business course; by the 
    end you will be interested in the hog and beef markets, and understand the 
    value of hard work and perseverance. You will also find out who Ralph marries!</h4>
  <h4>Alas, the series is done, where do we `go from here? May I suggest books 
    by another cowboy: Will James. (1892-1942) He not only wrote many books, but 
    illustrated them as well.</h4>

  <h4>A Newbery Medal book, written from the horse's point of view. The language 
    and grammar were difficult for me to adjust to; being a proofreader I wanted 
    to correct the verbs and spelling. However, it is a beautiful story and the 
    cowboy language is authentic... <img
