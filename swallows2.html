for which I have more reason to be grateful than my mother's regular reading

aloud, and the habit of eager reading to myself that her reading encouraged."</FONT></H4>



<H4>

<FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;"Whenever we were not out of doors we were

reading or listening to my mother reading aloud. Fortunately for us my

mother enjoyed this and read extremely well. For one thing, she would never

read aloud to us a book that she did not enjoy reading to herself. This

simple rule, which should be observed by all mothers who read aloud (and

I am sorry for the children of mothers who do not), saved us from a deal

of rubbish. Any book worth reading by children is also worth reading by

grown-up persons."</FONT></H4>
